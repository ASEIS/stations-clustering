\label{sec:results}

As explained in the methodology, the first step is to subject the dataset through a clustering process to properly label the data according to the classes to be used by the decision tree algorithm. Figure \ref{fig:clusters} presents a sample of the results obtained after the clustering process is completed. Because visual representation above 3 dimensions is not possible, in this figure we limit ourselves to present two-dimensional subspaces, i.e., for two features (or metrics). In total, as we mentioned before, there are 55 subspaces with 2 features, and 550 total in our analysis (done for subspaces with 2, 3, and 4). 

Figure \ref{fig:clusters} shows 6 subspaces for an ordered sequence of metric pairs from C1 to C11 (see Table \ref{tab:metrics}). As it can be seen, not all feature combinations lead to clearly distinguishable clusters. In this sample we include well-partitioned sets (e.g., C3-C4, C5-C6, C7-C8), and some others where the data is all mixed (e.g., C1-C2, C10-C11). Note also that although some data distribution may hint the existence of clusters, it is considered irrelevant because knowledge about one feature does not add value to the other. That is the case of the C9-C10 subspace. Conversely, there are subspaces with a clear correlation between the data, but with indistinguishable clusters. That is the case of the C1-C2 subspace. Such subspaces do not contribute information to the clustering process \citep{Dy_2004_MLR}.

These results are part of the 55 possible sub-spaces with 2 features (metrics). The cluster centers are shown with a cross symbol. Although for some pairs it may be obvious, the clusters 1 through 4 do not necessarily correspond in that order to the validation classes poor, fair, good, and excellent.

The distributions are shown in the form of box-plots for each metric (C1 through C11), and discretized in terms of the component of motion (NS, EW, UD) for visualization purposes. In each case, the median is indicated by a notch in the box of the central quartiles, and the lines represent the interquartile range, with outliers shown as scattered dots.

% Fig.~\ref{fig:C_cvm_comp} shows the results for different velocity models and components after clustering the dataset. A preliminary visually inspection shows that the behavior of scores with respect to the velocity model is fairly similar. Therefor we merge data of different velocity models.  and present them at Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_cluster_comp}.

% Although there are some differences in the scores based on different components, there are general similarities in all clusters for different metrics among their components. Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_cluster_all_comp} shows the results with merging the components. 

% Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_cluster_all_comp} presents the results from a broad perspective. Statistical tests can be helpful to understand the effect of component, velocity model, earthquake, and frequency band in the results.  According to Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_cluster_all_comp} scores C1, C2, and C11 has the least changes in different clusters. It suggests the idea that they may not helpful in defining a decision rule. On the other hand, other scores are fairly variable among different clusters. 
% Scores C1, C2, and C10 are very similar in cluster 1 to 3. However, we can see a small increase in cluster 4 for these scores. Also the data variation becomes small and range of data moves higher. Scores C3-C9 have a considerable increment from cluster 1 to cluster 4. Although there are a broad variation of data in cluster 3 and cluster 4 for these scores, good amount of data (50\% based on the IQR) are in a small range and increasing with respect to the clusters. C11 has a constant behavior with a small reduction in median at cluster 4. Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_cluster_barplot} shows number of stations in each cluster based on component. 




\subsection{Decision Trees}

In total, we built \textcolor{red}{XXX} trees corresponding to \textcolor{red}{XXX} CF values (varying between 0 and 1 at intervals of \textcolor{red}{0.1}) and \textcolor{red}{XXX} $S_{\min}$ values (varying between 1 and \textcolor{red}{XXX} at intervals of \textcolor{red}{XXX}).
