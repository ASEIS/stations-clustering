	\caption{A sample of the results from the multi-dimensional clustering analysis for pairs of consecutive metrics C1 through C11. These results are part of the 55 possible sub-spaces with 2 features (metrics). The cluster centers are shown with a cross symbol. Although for some pairs it may be obvious, the clusters 1 through 4 do not necessarily correspond in that order to the validation classes poor, fair, good, and excellent. The color version of this figure is available only in the electronic edition.}

\subsection{Decision Trees}

Working...

In total, we built \textcolor{red}{XXX} trees corresponding to \textcolor{red}{XXX} CF values (varying between 0 and 1 at intervals of \textcolor{red}{0.1}) and \textcolor{red}{XXX} $S_{\min}$ values (varying between 1 and \textcolor{red}{XXX} at intervals of \textcolor{red}{XXX}).
