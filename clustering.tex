\subsection{Clustering}
\label{sec:clustering}

The first step towards obtaining a decision tree is to label the data according to their attributes. The inherent attribute of our data are the GOF values, but because of the multiplicity of metrics and lack of clarity about their relationships, we need to label the data according to the validation categories. We do this by means of a clustering process. 

Clustering is an unsupervised data-mining process used to group data in a multi-dimensional space based on their attributes \citep{Fayyad_1996_IEEE}. According to \citet{Jain_1999_ACMCS}, clustering can be classified in two categories: hierarchical and partitional. Technical details aside, the basic difference is that hierarchical algorithms create nested partitions, whereas partitional algorithms produce singular partitions. 

There is no single clustering process that can be applied to every dataset \citep{Dy_2004_MLR, Jain_1988_Book, Hartigan_1985_JOC}. Consequently, one needs to make choices. We use a partitional, distance-based method known as constrained \kmeans{}. The standard \kmeans{} method is a process for partitioning a $n$-dimensional population into $k$ clusters with a minimum within-cluster attributes variance \citep[e.g.,][]{Macqueen_1967_Proc}. Constrained \kmeans{} extends this method by allowing the use of background information in the form of clustering restrictions.

Given a $k$ number of clusters, where each cluster is identified by its center, the standard process starts by computing the distances of all other data-points to the center of the clusters, and grouping them based on their proximity to the clusters' centers. Once this is done, the center of each cluster is updated based on the average attributes of its data-points, and the process is repeated until the clusters become stable.

This process is sensitive to the initial selection of the clusters and their centers. To mitigate this, constrained \kmeans{} introduces two types of constraints: must-link and cannot-link \citep{Wagstaff_2001_Proc}. The must-link constraint specifies instances in which two data-points must be linked, i.e., in the same cluster. The cannot-link constraint specifies instances in which data cannot be in the same cluster. This prevents the process from converging into a local minimum, and defines constrained \kmeans{} as a semi-supervised method. Figure \ref{fig:k-means} illustrates the differences between the standard and constrained \kmeans{} methods for a single clustering iteration on a small two-dimensional dataset.

In our implementation we limit the clustering to four validation categories: poor, fair, good, and excellent. The cluster centers are randomly selected at the start, but we apply constraints by adding 4 artificial stations with cannot-link conditions that are checked at the end of each iteration. These stations are associated with each type of cluster and have GOF scores equal to 3, 5, 7, and 9, across all metrics, thus they are representative of the validation categories.

	\label{fig:k-means}
\end{figure}

In the multi-dimensional space defined by the 11 GOF metrics used here, the distances are obtained using the Euclidean expression:
% 
\begin{equation}
	d(x_i, x_j) = \sqrt{ \sum_{l=1}^{n} \left( x_{i,l} - x_{j,l} \right)^2 } 
\end{equation}
% 
corresponding to the distance $d$ between the data-point $x_i$ and the cluster center $x_j$ in the $n$-dimensional domain, where $x_{i,l}$ is the $l$-th feature of the data-point $x_i$, and $x_{j,l}$ is the $l$-th feature of the cluster center $x_j$. It is, however, unpractical to expect the patterns defining the clusters to be observable across all features. Such high-dimensional issues are well known \citep[see, for instance,][]{Parsons_2004_ACM, Dy_2004_MLR}, and can be tackled using sub-spaces. Therefore, instead of analyzing all $2^{11}$ possible sub-spaces, we focus only on sub-spaces with 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, or features. In total, we analyze 550 sub-spaces, 55 sub-spaces with 2 features, 165 with 3, and 330 with 4.

Unfortunately, not all the sub-spaces will have clearly distinguishable clusters (i.e., some will not satisfy the cannot-link constraints even after a large number of iterations). Such sub-spaces are discarded, and all others are used to label the data. In an ideal case, each station will be labeled 550 times, and the final label is taken as the mode. For example, if after all the sub-spaces are accounted for, a station has labels $\left\{F, F, F, P, F, G, E, F, F\right\}$, where the labels $P$, $F$, $G$, and $E$ correspond to the poor, fair, good, and excellent category clusters, then such as station will be given a final label $F$. Once all the data is properly labeled, we proceed with the decision tree analysis.

% Although we do not expect to see the pattern that resulted from clustering using 11 features in presentation of only two, however, different studies show that the higher dimension reduce the effect of similarity based on distance. \citet{Parsons_2004_ACM} presented an illustrative example to show the effect of dimension in reducing the importance of the distance. Effect of higher dimensions in clustering has been well studied and many different methods are proposed to reduce this effect in the final results. Among them we can name  feature selection before, during, and after clustering, hybrid methods that use combination of methods to select the best subset of feature. \citet{Dy_2004_MLR} addressed two issues involved in developing an automated feature subset selection algorithm for unlabeled data. They illustrated the irrelevant and redundant features and proposed methods for evaluating candidate features using two performance criteria.

% Subspace analysis is another technique to address the challenges with higher dimensional data in clustering process. Subspace clustering is an extension of traditional clustering which looks for different pattern using subset of features.  \citet{Parsons_2004_ACM} provided a list of algorithm for conducting subspace clustering and also some potential applications for them. The most common factor among these algorithm is the process to find a group of best subspaces through optimization process. An n-dimensional dataset has $2^n$ subspaces where it could be very costly and time consuming to evaluate all of them.

% In this study we are interested in using those features who, in general, represent the simulation accuracy in 4 different categories. As a first step we use the constrained \kmeans{} clustering approach for all features, however, because of mentioned reasons the results are not easy to discuss or even evaluate. Although we have four groups of data, the question is which one should be considered as poor, fair, good, or excellent groups. Therefore, we apply a modified method of subspace clustering approach to cluster the stations. As we discussed earlier and presented in figures the constrained \kmeans{} method effectively put the stations in a cluster with considering the fact that our constrain stations should not be in the same cluster. High number of iteration leads the clustering process to follow the clustering concept that we are looking for which is clustering stations as poor, fair, good, and excellent. In our case number of possible subspace is $2^{11}$ where each features have two options wether belong to subspace or not. However, because of preserving the distance based criteria effects we limited the number of features in the subspace to be 2,3, and 4 features. Therefor we have 330,165, and 55 unique subspaces for 4D,3D, and 2D, respectively. We conduct a constrained \kmeans{} clustering analysis for each of these subspaces and repeat the algorithm. In some cases, it is not possible to distinguish all four cannot-link stations in different clusters. In this study we ignore these cases. We only use those combination of features that gives 4 unique clusters for the constraint points (hypothetical stations), therefore, we know for sure that all data within same cluster let's say with metric value 3, should be considered as poor. We also control the clusters to be consistent (we reformat numbers to assign cluster 1 to all group of stations that our first constraint belongs to them and so on). Finally, using 550 unique subspace clustering results, we assign the most frequent class to the station.





% and computes . These distances are then used as a criteria to determine the cluster to which cluster each data-point belongs. 

% ...


% \citet{Macqueen_1967_Proc} describes this method as a process for partitioning a $n$-dimensional population into $k$ sets on the basis of a sample. Its algorithm produces partitions that are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. It starts with a user defined number of clusters ($k$) and assigns a random mean value to each cluster (or randomly choose $k$ data-points and assigns them as cluster centers). After this, the algorithm computes the distances of all other data-points to the center of the cluster and uses the distance as a criteria to clustering the data points. Because the data resides in a multi-dimensional space (here defined by each metric), there are different ways of computing the distance of each data-point to the cluster's center. We use the Euclidean distance:
% % 
% \begin{equation}
% 	d(x_i, x_j) = \sqrt{ \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left( x_{i,k} - x_{j,k} \right)^2 } 
% 	\, ,
% \end{equation}
% % 
% where $n$ is the number of features and $d$ is the distance of $x_i$ and $x_j$ in $n$-$dimensional$ domain.

% Once the distance is computed, the algorithms labels the data based on the proximity of each point to each cluster, and computes the arithmetic mean value of the data for each cluster, and assigne that value as the updated location of each cluster's center. The algorithm repeats the steps unless the amount of updates among the cluster centers is less than a predefined tolerance value. The major problem with \kmeans{} algorithm is that it is sensitive to the selection of the initial partition and may converge to a local minimum of the criterion function value if the initial partition is not properly chosen. Another problem accompanying the use of \kmeans{} algorithm is the choice of the number of desired output clusters. \citep{Jain_1999_ACMCS}. Clustering is a subjective process. The same set of data items often needs to be partitioned differently for different application. In our application the number of clusters according to the literature is 4 (i.e., poor, fair, good, and excellent.) However, our initial attempts represents that the results are highly sensitive to the initial clusters' center. Therefore, we need to incorporate the experts knowlege in the process. 


% \citet{Wagstaff_2001_Proc}  demonstrated a modification of \kmeans{} clustering algorithm which uses the background information of the domain or dataset. The algorithm adds two types of constraints to the clustering including:
% 	% 
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 	\item{Must-link: constraints specify that two instances have to be in the same cluster.}
% 	\item{Cannot-link: constraints specify that two instance must not be placed in the same cluster.}
% 	\end{itemize} 
% 	% 
% The algorithm is described in detail in \citet{Wagstaff_2001_Proc}, however, in simple words, in the ordinary \kmeans{} process before assigning data to the closes cluster, it controls the must-link and cannot-link conditions. Therefore, in this case, the closest cluster's center is not necessarily the final cluster of the data.


% In a hypothetical assumption, if we have a pair of data and synthetic with GOF score of 3 for all metrics we could consider the overall simulation GOF as poor. This is also correct for 5,7, and 9 that we can assigne them fair, good, and excellent class, respectively. Therefore, we add 4 hypothetical stations into the dataset with GOF score of 3,5,7,and 9 for all metrics and we put them in cannot-link constraint. This assumption that originated from the experts knowledge, provides enough information to the algorithm to converge to the same final clusters and cluster centers after a reasonable amount of iteration.

Fig.~\ref{fig:con_kmeans}.b represents the constrained \kmeans{} approach, where, the closest cluster center is not necessarily the final cluster.

% OLD STUFF DONE BY RICARDO FOR THE INTRO OF THIS SECTION
% 
% In machine learning, decision trees are classified as a supervised learning method, and the first step towards designing them requires that the data be labeled according to their attributes. The inherent attribute of our data are the GOF value themselves, but because of the multiplicity of metrics and the lack of clarity about how these relate to each other, we need to add labels to the data that are in accordance with the outcome attributes, i.e., in terms of the predefined validation quality levels. We label the data in our dataset by means of a clustering process. 

% There exist different methods for clustering data \citep[see Chapters 10 and 11 in][]{Han_2011_Book}, among which the \kmeans{} and constrained \kmeans{} clustering methods are the most widely used \citep{Jain_1999_ACMCS}. We note about these methods that the \kmeans{} approach is sensitive to the initial values chosen to be at the center of the clusters---especially in the case of data that are not clearly distinguishable---, whereas the constrained \kmeans{} method uses background knowledge to overcome this limitation. Because of its use of background information, the modified \kmeans{} method is considered as a semi-supervised process.

% OLD NAEEM VERSION
% 
% Clustering is an unsupervised approach for grouping of data based on measure of similarity and it is considered as an exploratory activity as a part of data mining process \citep{Fayyad_1996_IEEE}. In each valid cluster, patterns are more similar in each other than they are to pattern belonging to a different cluster. Many clustering algorithms are developed for different application, however, study the difference of them is beyond the scope of this paper. In general, at the top level,  \citet{Jain_1999} distinguished the clustering approach into Hierarchical and Partitional approaches. Aside from differences in application and technical details in implementation, hierarchical methods produce nested series of partitions, while partitional methods produce only one. In this study we are interested in using partitional, distance based clustering algorithm, which is also known as \kmeans{} algorithm.  \citet{Macqueen_1967_Proc}  described a process for partitioning an $n$-$dimensional$ population into $k$ sets on the basis of a sample. The process appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. For numerical values, \kmeans{} algorithm starts with a user defined number of clusters (k) and assign a random mean value for each cluster (or randomly choose k data and assign them as cluster centers.) Then it computes the distance of data and cluster centers. A variety of distance measures are in use in different studies, however, we use the Euclidean distance through 

% \begin{equation}
% d(x_i,x_j)=\sqrt{\Sigma_{k=1}^{n}(x_{i,k} - x_{j,k})^2},
% \end{equation}

% where $n$ is the number of features and $d$ is the distance of $x_i$ and $x_j$ in $n$-$dimensional$ domain. After computing the distance of the points from each clusters' mean (center), the algorithm continues with labeling the data after the closest cluster. At the next iteration, it computes the mean value of data for each cluster and updates the clusters' centers. The algorithm repeats the steps unless the amount of updates among the cluster centers is less than a tolerance value.  \kmeans{} clustering has been applied in different applications, however, there is no clustering technique that is universally applicable in uncovering the variety of structures present in multidimensional datasets. Therefore, clustering is a subjective process. The same set of data items often needs to be partitioned differently for different application.
