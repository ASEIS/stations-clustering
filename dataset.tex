\section{Study Dataset}

We select the simulation results and validation analysis done by \citet{Taborda_2014_BSSA} as our \change{\textit{validation dataset}}. In that study, the authors carried out deterministic simulations for the 2008 \eqmag{w} 5.4 Chino Hills, California, earthquake using a finite-element approach. The simulations, done for a kinematic finite-fault model of the earthquake, were computed for a maximum frequency \fmaxeq{4} and a minimum shear wave velocity \vsmineq{200}. In total, \citet{Taborda_2014_BSSA} did three simulations, each for a different velocity model \citep[CVM-S4, CVM-H, CVM-H+GTL, see][]{Small_2017_SRL}. The modeling domain covered an area of \adomain{180}{135}{km} that included all the major sedimentary basins and other relevant geologic structures in the greater Los Angeles region. Their validation analysis consisted of comparisons with data recorded during the event at 336 ground motion monitoring stations, for the three \change{components} of motion (EW, NS, and UD). The simulation domain and the stations used in that study are shown in Figure \ref{fig:chino-hills}, and a sample of the validation results obtained by the authors using \citeauthor{Anderson_2004_Proc}'s approach is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ref-gof-maps}. This second figure, in particular, shows the spatial distribution of GOF scores (interpolated from the values at each station) for the comparison of the broadband synthetics and data, averaged for all metrics and the three \change{components} of motion.

Here, we use the GOF scores obtained by \citet{Taborda_2014_BSSA} independently of the velocity models and/or the \change{components of motion}. \change{We refer to the set of 11 scores associated with a pair of signals as one of the \textit{data samples} that compose our dataset.} Although at times we will make distinctions between the models and the components for visualization purposes, the clustering analysis to be described in the following section was done using \change{all the data samples in the validation dataset}. The motivation behind this choice was that the dataset, as a collection of GOF values, was independent of the simulations and serves here as a generic set of data samples for the purpose of identifying the correlations that exist between the different metrics in Table \ref{tab:metrics}. As such, given the simulations for each velocity model (3), the components of motion (3), and the number of stations used in the validation (336), gave us a large enough \change{dataset, with} 3,024 \change{data samples}. Figure \ref{fig:data-box-plot} illustrates the idea of a lack of dependence on the simulations by comparing the statistical distribution of the GOF scores of the simulations organized by velocity models and components. It is clear that although there are some differences between them, these are negligible. In other words, the statistical distribution of the data for each metric is about the same independently of model or component. Consequently, we felt it was alright to combine all the \change{data samples into a single dataset}.

In each case, \change{the boxes represent the interquartile range ($\mathrm{IQR} = \mathrm{Q}3 - \mathrm{Q}1$), the medians are indicated by a notch in the boxes, and the vertical lines show} the range of the data, with outliers (data less than $\mathrm{Q}1 - 1.5 \mathrm{IQR}$ and greater than $\mathrm{Q}3 + 1.5 \mathrm{IQR}$) shown as scattered dots.
